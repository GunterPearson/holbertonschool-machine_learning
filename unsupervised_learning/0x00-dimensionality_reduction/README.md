# 0x00-dimensionality_reduction
## In this section we begin to use unsupervised learning
### Learning Objectives:
1. What is eigendecomposition?
2. What is singular value decomposition?
3. What is the difference between eig and svd?
4. What is dimensionality reduction and what are its purposes?
5. What is principal components analysis (PCA)?
6. What is t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)?
7. What is a manifold?
8. What is the difference between linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction?
9. Which techniques are linear/non-linear?
