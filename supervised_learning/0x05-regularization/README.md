# 0x05-regularization
## In this section we learn to regularize weights in NN
### Learning Objectives:
1. What is regularization? What is its purpose?
2. What is are L1 and L2 regularization? What is the difference between the two methods?
3. What is dropout?
4. What is early stopping?
5. What is data augmentation?
6. How do you implement the above regularization methods in Numpy? Tensorflow?
7. What are the pros and cons of the above regularization methods?
