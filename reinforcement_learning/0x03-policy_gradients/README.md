# 0x03-policy_gradients
In this project, I will implement my own Policy Gradient in a loop of reinforcement learning (by using the Monte-Carlo policy gradient algorithm - also called ```REINFORCE```).
## Learning Objectives:
1. What is Policy?
2. How to calculate a Policy Gradient?
3. What and how to use a Monte-Carlo policy gradient?
