# holbertonschool-machine_learning
This repository contains projects for the Machine Learning scpecialization at Holberton School. Holberton School's Machine Learning scpecialization teaches the fundamentals of an emerging and exciting field of study that has implications in almost every industry. The projects included in this repository are mathematical concepts needed for Machine Learning, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforement Learning. Below you will see all four directories and the projects within, I have highlighted important projects inside each directory that you can click on to find out more.

## Python Libraries

## Authors

#### Gunter Pearson:
I am currently studying Machine Learning at Holberton School in Tulsa, Oklahoma and will graduate in January 2022. While working through these projects I have found a passion in problem solving and a need for finding more and more efficient algorithms as I practice and prepare my skills for technical interviews.
