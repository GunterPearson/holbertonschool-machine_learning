#### Gunter Pearson:
I am currently studying Machine Learning at Holberton School in Tulsa, Oklahoma and will graduate in January 2022. While working through these projects I have found a passion in problem solving and a need for finding more and more efficient algorithms as I practice and prepare my skills for technical interviews.
